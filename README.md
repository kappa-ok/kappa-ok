# Howdy!

My name is Kappa! I'm a software and game developer who loves FOSS.

# What I Do

## Kaffeehaus Software

I'm the founder and lead developer over at @KaffeehausSoftware, where I work on maintaining Qrow (although no updates have been made in a while, sorry!), and have been working on a secret new project!

## In The Box Game Studios

In The Box Game Studios is where me, my partner Cherubiique, and occasional others work together to create fun little games.

## Solo Game Dev

I also make my own games! You can find me on itch and gamejolt as OverlordKappa6.

# What I Like

## Games

Some of my favourite games are Night In The Woods (I have Mae tattooed on my left arm), Undertale, Hollow Knight, Brawlhalla, and Castlevania: Curse Of Darkness.

I love story-rich games with good gameplay, which is what I aim to make (although I have yet to do so!).

## Music

Some of my favourite bands are Modest Mouse, Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins, Car Seat Headrest, System Of A Down, and Radiohead.

All of them have such wonderful aspects and vast differences, and although there are similarities between my favourites my total musical pallette is incredibly varied.
